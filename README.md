💼 CodSoft Internship Projects – codsoft_2
This repository contains the projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project is built using Python and the Streamlit framework to create interactive web applications. Below is an overview of the three mini-projects included:

🔐 1. Password Generator (intern.py)
A simple app that generates secure, random passwords.

Features:
Choose password length (4 to 64 characters).

Option to include special characters (like !@#$%^&*).

Easy-to-use UI for generating strong passwords.

How It Works:
Uses Python's string and random modules.

Generates a random combination of letters, digits, and symbols based on user preferences.
